ORACLE Architecture
-------------------

MEMORY STRUCTURE

   Software Code Areas:
      * Memory area from where Stored code executes

   ------------------------
   System global area (SGA)
   ------------------------
      * Holds the shared memory structures, for server and background processes.
      * Holds the Oracle Database instance. 
      * Holds cached data blocks and shared SQL areas.

      Database Buffer Cache
         * Holds copies of data blocks read from datafiles
         * LRU(Least recently used) Lists, MRU(Most recently used),
           Pinned Buffers (Currently in use buffer locations), Free Buffers

      Redo Log Buffer
         * All DML /DDL entries are copied from the user's memory space to the redo
           log buffer in the SGA. Which is continuous and sequential buffer sequence.
           A background process LGWR(LogWriter) writes the redo log buffer to the 
           active redo log file (on disk).

      Shared Pool
         * Library Cache, Dictionary Cache, Result Cache
         * Shared area for all SQL PL/SQL executions and result cache
           (to use common execution data elements)

      Large Pool (Session Memory  and I/O Process)
      Java Pool  (For Oracle Java Stored Procs execution and handling)
      Streams Pool (For Replication with Oracle Streams)

   -------------------------
   Program Global Area (PGA)
   -------------------------
      * Memory to process SQL statement
      * Memory to hold logon other session information.
      * Cursors and SQL Areas
      * Persistent area, This area contains bind variable values
      * Runtime area,    Query execution state information
      * SQL work areas, For joins, group by sort operations

   ORACLE STORAGE
   --------------
   
      Oracle Data Blocks   
         * Rows are stored in datablocks 
           (Block Size can be set using DB_BLOCK_SIZE Initialization parameter).
         * Each block has Header info, Row Data (PCTUSED) and Free Space(PCTFREE)
         * PCTUSED: Percentage of the block that can be used for the row insert.
         * PCTFREE: Percentage of the block that can be used for the row update.
         * Row Chaining, row spanning across multiple blocks.
      
      Oracle Extents
         * Logical unit of database storage space allocation made up of a number of contiguous data blocks.
         * To dealloate space use the statement: ALTER TABLE table_name DEALLOCATE UNUSED;
         * INITIAL, NEXT, PCTINCREASE and MINEXTENTS, Size parameters for Extents

      Oracle Segments
         * Set of extents for a specific logical storage structure (Table, Materialized View) in a tablespace.

      Temp Segment
         * Temporary workspace for intermediate stages of SQL statement parsing and execution.
         * CREATE INDEX, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, Select Distinct, UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS.
         * As a SQL statement is also a logical storage structure (temporarily untill its executed).
         
      Undo Segment
         * ROLLBACK data is saved here untill a commit is issued.
